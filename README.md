# yak-wp-theme
An intentional minimalist WordPress Theme
I did not use Underscores and an other starter themes. I did it completely from sretch / blank files, because I like pain. It's better than root canal.

WARNING: Don't use it though. It's not quite production ready. I'll work on all the santitation and security fixes later.
