# yak-wp-theme
An intentional minimalist WordPress Theme
I did not use Underscores or any other starter theme. I did it completely from sretch / blank files, mainly for the learning experience, but maybe I'll turn it into something useful. I'll keep working on it in my spare time.

WARNING: Don't use it though. It's not quite production ready. I'll work on all the santitation and security fixes later.
